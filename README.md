# climate_viz
Visualisations I have made of open source climate change data. Organised into the (1) Emissions (2) Concentrations (3) Temperatures framework.

Contains Jupyter Notebooks I have written to produce the graphics and PNGs of the graphics I have produced. (Add data files?)

Very much a work in progress.

Most recent combined figure is below:
